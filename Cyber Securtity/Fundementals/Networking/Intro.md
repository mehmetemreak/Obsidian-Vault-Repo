Networks are simply things connected. For example, your friendship circle: you are all connected because of similar interests, hobbies, skills and sorts. 
In computing, networking is the same idea, just dispersed to technological devices. Take your phone as an example; the reason that you have it is to access things. We'll cover how these devices communicate with each other and the rules that follow.

Networks are integrated into our everyday life. Be it gathering data for the weather, delivering electricity to homes or even determining who has the right of way at a road. Because networks are so embedded in the modern-day, networking is an essential concept to grasp in cybersecurity.

Networks come in all shapes and sizes, Just like boobs.

# What is the Internet?

The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself.

The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the **W**orld **W**ide **W**eb (**WWW**). It wasn't until this point that the Internet started to be used as a repository for storing and sharing information, just like it is today.

The Internet is made up of many small networks all joined together.  These small networks are called private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks -- or the Internet! So, to recap, a network can be one of two types:  

- A private network  
    
- A public network

Devices will use a set of labels to identify themselves on a network, which we will come onto in the task below.

# Identifying Devices

Devices on a network are very similar to humans in the fact that we have two ways of being identified:

- Our Name
- Our Fingerprints

Now we can change our name through deed poll, but we can't, however, change our fingerprints. Every human has an individual set of fingerprints which means that even if they change their name, there is still an identity behind it. Devices have the same thing: two means of identification, with one being permeable. These are:

- An IP Address
- A Media Access Control (MAC) Address -- think of this as being similar to a serial number.

## IP Addresses

Briefly, an IP address (or **I**nternet **P**rotocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing. First, let's split up precisely what an IP address is in the diagram below:

An **IP** address is a set of numbers that are divided into four octets. The value of each octet will summarise to be the IP address of the device on the network. This number is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting. What's important to understand here is that IP addresses can change from device to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network.

 devices can be on both a private and public network. Depending on where they are will determine what type of IP address they have: a public or private IP address.

A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices.

| **Device Name** | **IP Address** | **IP Address Type** |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| DESKTOP-KJE57FD | 192.168.1.77   | Private             |
| DESKTOP-KJE57FD | 86.157.52.21   | Public              |
| CMNatic-PC      | 192.168.1.74   | Private             |
| CMNatic-PC      | 86.157.52.21   | Public              |

These two devices will be able to use their private IP addresses to communicate with each other. However, any data sent to the Internet from either of these devices will be identified by the same public IP address.

As more and more devices become connected, it is becoming increasingly harder to get a public address that isn't already in use.
IPv6 is a new iteration of the Internet Protocol addressing scheme to help tackle this issue. Although it is seemingly more daunting, it boasts a few benefits:

- Supports up to 2^128 of IP addresses (340 trillion-plus), resolving the issues faced with IPv4
- More efficient due to new methodologies

The screenshot below compares both an IPv6 and IPv4 address.

# MAC Addresses

Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a **MAC** (**M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol ) address. The MAC address is a **twelve-character** hexadecimal number (_a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers_) split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators. For example, [_a4:c3:f0](https://maclookup.app/macaddress/a4c3f0):85:ac:2d_. The first six characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.
